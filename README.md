Heralded as a hard working talented young man, the New England Patriots took a chance on him, meaning to pair him up with another future superstar Rob Gronkowski. Hernandez's family was known throughout Bristol, Mr Hernandez was a very serious strict man, he would come home drunk and fight with his wife. All while Aaron and his brother DJ had no choice but to be around the chaos.]</h1>

                    <h3>[The death of Aaron Hernandez can also be used as a cautionary tale for young gay men who have to live in fear afraid of what others would think of you. Hernandez allegedly had a 4-year long relationship with his High School Quarterback Tom Soucie. Both men were keeping their true selves away from the public out of fear of being judged and looked at differently. It was known that Hernandez's father (like the QBs father) was incredibly homophobic. The word "F*gg would be used often in the Hernandez household. Imagine being a 6'5 250 lb man instantly losing all your "credibiliy" because of who you choose to sleep with. No excuses for what Hernandez did but one can certainly see what made him this way.]</h3>

                    <h3>[Odin Lloyd was allegedly picked up in a vehicle containing Hernandez and 2 accomplices. They would drive out to a Boston Suburb where the only people the victim knew was Hernandez and his Fiancee Shayanna. Fearing for his life Odin Lloyd would send a text message to his sister and letting her know who he was with at the time. But an hour later Lloyd was dead and Hernandez and his boys were headed back to Bristol. It is unknown what the motive was to kill Lloyd. And even less understandable to murder your wifes sister's husband.]</h3>

                    <h3>[2 other hispanic men were murdered at a stoplight by Hernandez, he pulled up next to the car and unloaded his .38 into the vehicle, killing both passengers. This happened before the Lloyd fiasco. In fact a month after he killed those 2 men he received a 5 yr 40 Million $ contract extension. He would then go on to play a whole season after killing 2 people. Players on the Patriots were of course shocked, as well as his Florida teammates from college.]</h3>

He moved in with her after his mother had an affair with Tanya's husband, after his father passed away. Tanya was the reason Aaron got away with the first 2 murders for so long. She hid the car on her property knowing she is not a suspect in any case. Regardless the car, a silver SUV was found cobwebbed and not used in at least a year. ]</h3>

                    <h1 class="text-uppercase">Aaron Hernandez is a tragic story about CTE and the glaring homophobia in our world. He commited suicide 3 years ago and lent his brain to researchers before he died. A 27-year old man had the brain of an 80 year old. These are the dangers of playing football. These things you can't predict. Junior Seau is another great NFL Player who killed himself in retirement and the CTE was rampant in Seau's head. Antonio Brown is a case of us noticing CTE before its too late. Antonio took a brutal cheap shot to the helmet and his behavior quite frankly has never been the same since. Cause and corrolation? The problem is you cant reseach a brain until the person has passed away. So something tragic would have to happen to Antonio Brown for the league to be able to experiment on his brain</h1>
